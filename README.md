# Results and Keywords

Trained on the MIMIC-III dataset, our neural network provides first-day predictions for patient length-of-stay with 90.438% accuracy and RMSE of 19.762 hours. We used a set of deep learning technique, for example applying the lastest BioBERT for Natrual Language Processing on doctor notes.
